pindist is not really fancy but seems to be easy to use nonetheless. Anyway, there follows some instructions about using it.

== Attributing PINs to users ==

This module will appear in the menu as "PIN Distribution":

Click on it. Then, you will see the list of all PIN sets:

Click on the one you want to take a PIN from for someone. You will see all available PINs, as well the ones that are already attributed (in this case, none):

To associate a PIN to someone, just click in the "Attribute" button ({{http://i.imgur.com/tS2Lv.png}}). You will get a form like the one below:

Type the name of the person and click on the submit button. A "Back" link will appear:

After clicking on it, you will return to the list of PINs. Now the selected one is listed as "Attributed":

== Disassociating PINs from users ==

To revoke a PIN from an user, just click in the "Disassociate" button ({{http://i.imgur.com/gKl4a.png}}) and then click in "Back".

Note that disassociating //does not disable the PIN neither impedes the disassociated user from using the PIN//. If you want to disable the PIN, you should remove it from the PIN set.
